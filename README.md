## ⚡ What is Flynn?

Flynn is a high-performance AI assistant built for Slack, Discord, teams, and large communities.

It doesn’t freeze when thinking.  
It doesn’t stall when running tools.  
It doesn’t crumble under 100 simultaneous conversations.

Flynn separates:

- 💬 Conversation
- 🧠 Thinking
- 🛠 Execution
- 🗂 Structured Memory

So it stays fast. Always.

## 🏗 Core Philosophy

> The channel talks.  
> Branches think.  
> Workers execute.  
> Nothing ever blocks.

Every message spawns a lightweight branch.  
Heavy work runs in isolated workers.  
The conversation layer remains instantly responsive.

Concurrency first. Structure over chaos. Speed over gimmicks.

## 🧠 Structured Memory (Not Just Vectors)

Flynn turns your:

- Documents  
- Notes  
- Chat histories  
- Codebases  

Into typed, structured memory with graph relationships and hybrid search.

No markdown hacks.  
No vibe-based recall.  
Real memory.
